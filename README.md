# Total-rainfall-misssing-water-detection
We can calculate the total area of surface water lost by selecting both classes.
The binary operator eq is used to select a particular class and create a binary image representing the availability of the class. The boolean operator or is used to create a binary image where either class value is present.
The JRC Yearly Water Classification History image collection contains the spatiotemporal map of surface water from 1984 to 2020. A total of 37 images represent 1 image for each year.
